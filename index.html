                  <p > 1.Present Perfect:
                    The subject in Present Perfect is the noun or pronoun that represents the doer of the action or the one to whom the action has happened at an indefinite time before now.

                  <p >  4.Phrasal modal
                    Phrasal modal verbs are a combination of a modal verb and a preposition or adverb, which together create a unique meaning. Here's an explanation of some common phrasal modal verbs along with examples:
                  <br><br> Can/could + not help (doing something):

                  <p > 5. Participles: 
                    Present Participles:
                    Present participles are formed by adding "-ing" to the base form of a verb.
                    Example: The running water, a singing bird.
                    
                    Present participles are often used to describe ongoing actions or as adjectives to modify nouns. They can also be used to form the present continuous tense (e.g., "I am running") or the present perfect continuous tense (e.g., "She has been singing").
                    Past Participles:
                    Past participles are formed by adding "-ed," "-d," "-t," "-en," or other irregular endings to the base form of a verb.
                    Example: The baked cake, a broken window.
                    
                    Past participles are often used to describe completed actions or as adjectives to modify nouns. They can also be used to form the past tense (e.g., "They have arrived") or the passive voice (e.g., "The book was written").
                    
                    Both present and past participles can be used to create verb phrases, such as present participial phrases (e.g., "Running swiftly, he caught the ball") or past participial phrases (e.g., "Having finished her homework, she went to bed"). These phrases add more information and detail to sentences.
               <br> <br>     Participles are versatile linguistic tools that allow us to convey descriptive information and create complex sentence structures in English. Understanding their usage can enhance your writing and communication skills.

                  <h4 > Adjective Clauses</h4>
                  <p > djective clauses, also known as relative clauses, are dependent clauses that function as adjectives to modify or describe a noun or pronoun in a sentence. They provide additional information about the noun or pronoun they are attached to. Here's an explanation of adjective clauses:
                    Structure:
                    Adjective clauses begin with a relative pronoun (such as "who," "whom," "whose," "which," or "that") or a relative adverb (such as "where," "when," or "why").
                    The clause contains a subject and a verb and cannot stand alone as a complete sentence.
                     <br><br>
                    Examples:
                    The woman who is standing by the door is my sister. (The adjective clause "who is standing by the door" provides additional information about the noun "woman.")
                    The book that I borrowed from the library is really interesting. (The adjective clause "that I borrowed from the library" describes the noun "book" and specifies which book is being referred to.)
                    I visited the city where I was born. (The adjective clause "where I was born" provides additional information about the noun "city" and specifies the location.)

                  <h4 > Countable-Noncountable</h4>
                  <p > Countable and uncountable nouns are two categories of nouns based on their ability to be counted. Here's an explanation of countable and uncountable nouns: <br><br>
                    Countable Nouns:
                    Countable nouns refer to objects or things that can be counted as separate units.
                    They have both singular and plural forms.
                    Examples: book (books), chair (chairs), dog (dogs)
                    <br><br>
                    Uncountable Nouns: <br>
                    Uncountable nouns, also known as non-count nouns, refer to things that cannot be counted as separate units or individual items. <br><br>
                    They typically represent substances, concepts, or qualities that are considered as a whole or in bulk.
                    Uncountable nouns do not have plural forms.
                    Examples: water, information, happiness

                  <h4 > Gerunds and infinitives</h4>
                  <p >Gerunds and infinitives are verb forms that function as nouns in a sentence. Here's an explanation of gerunds and infinitives: <br>
                    Gerunds: <br><br>
                    
                    Gerunds are verb forms that end in "-ing" and function as nouns in a sentence.
                    They are derived from verbs but are used to represent actions or activities as nouns.
                    Examples: Swimming is my favorite hobby. (Gerund as the subject) She enjoys reading books. (Gerund as the object)
                    <br><br>
                    Infinitives: <br><br>
                    
                    Infinitives are the base form of a verb, usually preceded by the word "to" (e.g., to eat, to write).
                    They can function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs in a sentence.
                    Examples: I want to learn how to play the guitar. (Infinitive as the object) It is important to study regularly. (Infinitive as an adjective modifying "important")

                  <h4 > Appositives</h4>
                  <p >An appositive is a noun or noun phrase that provides additional information or identifies another noun or pronoun in a sentence. It serves to further describe or clarify the noun or pronoun it is placed next to. Here's an explanation of appositives: <br><br>
                    Structure:
                    
                    An appositive is typically placed immediately after the noun or pronoun it modifies.
                    It is usually set off by commas, dashes, or parentheses.
                    Example: My sister, a talented artist, painted a beautiful portrait.
                    <br><br>
                    Purpose:
                    
                    Appositives provide additional information, description, or identification about a noun or pronoun.
                    They help to clarify or provide more details about the noun or pronoun in the sentence. <br>
                    Example: My friend Tim, a doctor, offered his assistance.
                     <br><br>
                    Types of Appositives:
                    
                    Restrictive Appositives: These appositives are necessary to identify or define the noun or pronoun. They are not set off by commas.
                    Example: The author John Green wrote "The Fault in Our Stars."
                    <br><br>
                    Non-restrictive Appositives: These appositives provide additional information about the noun or pronoun but are not essential for identification or definition. They are set off by commas.
                    <br><br>
                    Example: My dog, a playful Labrador retriever, loves to chase balls

                  <h4 > Tricky English Verb</h4>
                  <p >Irregular Verbs:

                    Irregular verbs do not follow the regular pattern of verb conjugation.
                    They have unique forms for the past tense and past participle.
                    Examples: go (went, gone), eat (ate, eaten), have (had, had)
                     <br>
                    Phrasal Verbs:
                    <br>
                    Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and one or more particles (prepositions or adverbs). <br>
                    They often have a different meaning than the base verb alone. <br>
                    Examples: look up (search for information), put off (postpone), take off (remove)
                     <br>
                    
                    Verb + Preposition Combinations:
                    
                    Certain verbs are always followed by specific prepositions to form commonly used expressions.
                    Examples: look forward to, rely on, think of, listen to
                    It's important to learn these verb + preposition combinations as separate vocabulary items.
